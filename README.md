# Thoughtful-Pack-Classifier
Takes package data → width, height, length (cm), and mass (kg)  Applies business rules:  Bulky if volume ≥ 1,000,000 cm³ or any dimension ≥ 150 cm  Heavy if mass ≥ 20 kg  Classifies the package into one of three categories:  STANDARD → neither bulky nor heavy  SPECIAL → bulky or heavy  REJECTED → both bulky and heavy
